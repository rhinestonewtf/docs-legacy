# Email Recovery

The Email Recovery module allows smart accounts to be recovered using email verification powered by [ZK Email](https://zk.email). This provides an intuitive recovery method that allows anyone familiar with email to act as a guardian, while preserving privacy and through zero-knowledge proofs.

## How it works

Email Recovery is a executor module that enables account recovery through email verification. When a guardian is set, their email address is hashed and stored on-chain. During recovery, the guardian's email response generates a ZK proof that validates against this stored hash, allowing them to authorize changes to validator configurations.

## Getting started

To enable email recovery, you need to install the Email Recovery module. Once installed, configure the recovery settings by setting a guardian email and timelock duration â€” this creates a delay period between when guardians approve recovery and when it can be executed, providing security against malicious recovery attempts.

The system will automatically send verification emails to each guardian. Guardians must confirm their role by simply replying to this verification email. This ensures guardians are aware of their responsibility and have access to the email account.
