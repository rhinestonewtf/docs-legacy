# Types

The Module SDK comes with a set of core types to make the developer experience more consistent and predictable. These types are used throughout the SDK and are designed to be future-proof. Individual modules may also have their own types, which are documented in the module's documentation.

## `Account`

The `Account` type is a type that represents an account. It has the following properties:

- `address`: The address of the account
- `initCode`: The init code of the account
- `type`: The type of the account
- `deployedOnChains`: The chains on which the account is deployed (represented as an array of chainIds)

```typescript
type Account = {
  address: Address;
  initCode?: Hex;
  type: AccountType;
  deployedOnChains: Number[];
};
```

The `AccountType` type is a string literal type that represents the type of the account. It has the following options:

```typescript
type AccountType = "erc7579-implementation";
```

## `Module`

The `Module` type is a type that represents a module. It has the following properties:

- `module`: The address of the module
- `data`: The installation or uninstallation data to be sent to the module
- `additionalContext`: The additional context to be sent to the module
- `type`: The type of the module

```typescript
type Module = {
  module: Address;
  data?: Hex;
  additionalContext?: Hex;
  type: ModuleType;
};
```

The `ModuleType` type is a string literal type that represents the type of the module. It has the following values:

```typescript
type ModuleType = "validators" | "executors" | "hooks" | "fallbacks";
```

## `Action`

The `Action` type is a type that represents an action that is executed on the account. It has the following properties:

- `target`: The address of the target
- `value`: The native token value of the action
- `callData`: The calldata of the action to be executed on the target

```typescript
type Action = {
  target: Address;
  value: BigInt;
  callData: Hex;
};
```
