# Clients

The Module SDK requires a viem client to interact with the blockchain. The client is used to send transactions and read data from the blockchain. The client object is of type `PublicClient` from viem.

## `getClient`

The `getClient` function is used to create a client object for the current network in a future-proof way. This function returns a client object of type `PublicClient` from viem.

```typescript
import { getClient } from "@rhinestone/module-sdk";

const client = getClient({
  rpcUrl: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/1234...",
});
```
