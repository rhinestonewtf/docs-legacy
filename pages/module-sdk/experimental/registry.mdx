# Registry

The [Registry](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/registry/) is an onchain component that stores attestations made on modules. This allows users to get security information about a module before installing it. The ModuleSDK provides utilities to query the Registry.

## `getRegistryModules`

The `getRegistryModules` function is used to get the modules that are registered in the registry. This function returns a promise that resolves to an array of module objects.

```typescript
import { getRegistryModules } from "@rhinestone/module-sdk";

const modules = getRegistryModules();
```
