# ModuleSDK

**A TypeScript library for using Smart Account Modules in Applications**

Use the ModuleSDK to integrate smart account modules into your application. It allows you to easily install and uninstall modules for any [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/) account, interact with and use modules using dedicated helper utilites and can be used alongside existing account SDKs such as [permissionless.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/permissionless), [Biconomy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@biconomy/account), [ZeroDev](https://docs.zerodev.app) and many more.

The Module SDK is split into two components:

- **Accounts** - Account-related helpers, like installing and uninstalling modules
- **Modules** - Integrated core modules with helpers for their installation and usage

<div className="my-8">
  <ModuleSDKBanner width={1000} height={400} />
</div>

Current accounts supported by the Module SDK include:

- **Safe**
- **Kernel v3**
- **Biconomy v3** (soon)

The integrated modules include:

- **Auto Savings**: Automatically save a percentage of incoming funds
- **ColdStorage Hook**: Prevent funds from being withdrawn without a timelock
- **Deadman Switch**: Prevent funds from being locked forever
- **Hook Multiplexer**: Combine multiple hooks into one with fine-grained control over when they are called
- **Multi Factor**: Use multiple validators in combination as a multi-factor authentication system
- **Ownable Executor**: Allow an account to control a subaccount and pay for its transaction fees
- **Ownable Validator**: Authenticate on your account with multiple ECDSA keys
- **Registry Hook**: Query the Module Registry before installing and using modules
- **Scheduled Orders**: Execute swaps on a specified schedule
- **Scheduled Transfers**: Transfer funds on a specified schedule
- **Social Recovery:** Recover your account using a set of guardians
- **WebAuthn Validator**: Use passkeys to sign transactions to be executed on the account
