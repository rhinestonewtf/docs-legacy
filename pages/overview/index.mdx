# Welcome

Rhinestone is a programmable and open platform for chain-abstracted Smart Accounts. [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/), the leading shared standard for Modular Smart Accounts, underpins our infrastructure and tooling, making it the only account vendor-agnostic smart wallet platform. ERC-7579 is now supported by all significant Smart Accounts, including Safe, Biconomy Nexus, ZeroDev Kernel, Magic’s Newton, Thirdweb, Trust Wallet, OKX, and many more. With [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) around the corner (via [Pectra](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7600)) EOAs will soon be welcomed to the Rhinestone platform.

Build with Rhinestone to maximize distribution, ensure broader ecosystem interoperability, and significantly enhance your product UX with the [deepest library](/module-sdk) of Smart Account features ([Modules](/overview/modules)) and native intent-based chain abstraction.

## Chain Abstraction

Rhinestone’s chain abstraction system utilizes Smart Account Modules and an intent-based settlement layer built on Across to chain abstract any ERC-7579 smart account and Smart EOAs. This system prioritizes programmability, interoperability, and self-sovereignty. 

Dive into a deeper overview of [Omni Account](/omni-account). 

## Modular Smart Accounts

Smart Accounts are the future of Ethereum. They drastically enhance application UX with features like gas abstraction, batching, and passkeys. They also provide critical security features to enable any user to be truly self-sovereign, including recovery, multi-sig, and more. 

The power of Smart Accounts lies in their programmability. Rhinestone is a leader in Modular Smart Accounts and has played an integral role in building and defining key technical primitives to unlock smart accounts as the next open platform for innovation. [Rhinestone’s infrastructure](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/rhinestone-protocol-1-0-hits-mainnet-695469dce425) enables anyone to extend the feature set of any ERC-7579 account.
