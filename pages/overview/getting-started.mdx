# Getting started

The fastest way to start building a smart account module is by using ModuleKit, a development kit for building and testing modules. This guide will walk you through installing ModuleKit and setting yourself up to start building innovative modules.

ModuleKit is based on Foundry, a toolchain to simplify and speed up smart contract development. If you are not familiar with Foundry, feel free to check out [their docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

    If you do not have foundry installed, run the following command and follow the onscreen instructions: ```bash curl
    -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash ```

## Installation

1. Install ModuleKit by using our template or adding it into an existing foundry project:

   ```bash {{ title: "template" }}
   git clone https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/module-template.git
   cd module-template
   forge install
   ```

   ```bash {{ title: "existing foundry project" }}
   forge install rhinestonewtf/modulekit
   ```

## Building a module

The ModuleKit makes building a module a straightforward process. Simply create a new contract in `src/[MODULE_TYPE]` and inherit from the correct interface for that module type. Learn more about module types and their interfaces [here](/modulekit/modules#module-types). Apart from that, the only thing you need to do is adhere to the interface by implementing all required functions and, if building a validator, adhere to the [additional requirements](/modulekit/modules#module-types). For hands-on guides to building modules, visit the [tutorials](/tutorials) section of the docs.

## Testing a module

The ModuleKit provides an end-to-end testing framework to make it easy for you to test your modules and abstract away all the complexities. To start testing a module simply create a `.t.sol` file under `test/[MODULE_TYPE]` and inherit from the right `RhinestoneModuleKit` library depending on which account you want to test your Module against, as well as Foundry's `Test`. Now you can use the provided [tools](/modulekit/tools) in order to simplify and accelerate the testing of your module. For hands-on guides to testing modules, visit the [tutorials](/tutorials) section of the docs.

## Deploying a module

The ModuleKit allows you to easily deploy and register your Module on the [Module Registry](/registry). To do so, simply create a script in the `script/` folder and inherit from the provided `RegistryDeployer` library. Learn more about deploying and registering modules [here](/modulekit/tools#deploying-modules). For hands-on guides to deploying modules, visit the [deployment tutorial](/tutorials/deploying-modules).
