# Module Registration

Modules are smart contracts that hold self-contained features for smart accounts. These modules and their deployment metadata are stored on the Registry, allowing others to attest to them in order for users to find out whether a module is secure or not. Modules can be registered on the Registry in two different ways: during and after deployment.

## During Deployment

You can register a Module on the Registry by deploying it through one of the Registry's deployment functions. These functions are:

`deploy` - Deploys a module using `CREATE2` and registers it on the Registry.

```solidity
function deploy(
    bytes calldata code,
    bytes calldata deployParams,
    bytes32 salt,
    bytes calldata metadata,
    ResolverUID resolverUID
)
    external
    payable
    nonReentrant
    returns (address moduleAddr);
```

`deployC3` - Deploys a module using [`CREATE3`](https://github.com/0xsequence/create3) and registers it on the Registry.

```solidity
function deployC3(
    bytes calldata code,
    bytes calldata deployParams,
    bytes32 salt,
    bytes calldata metadata,
    ResolverUID resolverUID
)
    external
    payable
    nonReentrant
    returns (address moduleAddr);
```

`deployViaFactory` - Deploys a module using a developer-supplied factory and registers it on the Registry.

```solidity
function deployViaFactory(
    address factory,
    bytes calldata callOnFactory,
    bytes calldata metadata,
    ResolverUID resolverUID
)
    external
    payable
    nonReentrant
    returns (address moduleAddr);
```

## After Deployment

Modules can also be registered after they have already been deployed. This is done by calling the `register` function on the Registry.

```solidity
function register(
    ResolverUID resolverUID,
    address moduleAddress,
    bytes calldata metadata
)
    external;
```

After a successful Module registration, the Module Registry will store the Module in a `ModuleRecord`, that looks like this:

```solidity
struct ModuleRecord {
    ResolverUID resolverUID; // The unique identifier of the resolver.
    address implementation; // The deployed contract address
    address sender; // The address of the sender who deployed the contract
    bytes metadata; // Additional data related to the contract deployment
}
```

You can query the Module Registry for a Module by using the `getModule` function.

```solidity
function _getModule(address moduleAddress)
    internal
    view
    virtual
    returns (ModuleRecord storage)
```
