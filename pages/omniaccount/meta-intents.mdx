# Meta Intents 

Omni Account employs an ERC-712 signature envelope to encode complex cross-chain intents into a single signature. This signature contains the cross-chain routes and arbitrary call data to be executed on the destination chain, allowing any intent to atomically execute with the cross-chain transfers once funds hit the target chain. From the user's perspective, this is one interaction for any intent that happens instantaneously, as if they have transacted on the same chain where their assets reside.

If Ethereum’s horizontal scaling strategy plays out as expected, the first time a user interacts with an onchain app will likely be their first interaction with a new chain. Therefore, a scalable Chain Abstraction system must enable instant cross-chain intents even if the user does not have an account on the destination chain. Omni Account provides this functionality with a just-in-time deployment flow via the ERC-4337 entrypoint contract. With one signature, the user authorizes the intent and the deployment of the Omni Account. The solver fronts the gas for deployment and fills the intent all in one!

Omni Account enables instant and atomic cross-chain intents, even when the user does not have a Smart Account on the destination chain. When the Relayer fills the Meta Intent, a userOp payload is included, which is handled by a trampoline contract that deploys the account via the ERC-4337 EntryPoint contract.

When the user’s Smart Account is deployed on the new destination chain, the Omni Account Modules are initialized, and the injected execution is executed. This initialization ensures that any assets held on the new chain are also Chain Abstracted and ready to be used on any other network.
