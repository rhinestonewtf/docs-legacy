# ModuleSandbox

**A frontend playground building and testing smart account modules**

The Module Sandbox is a frontend playground for building and testing frontend components for smart account modules. It is designed to make it easy to build frontend applications that are powered by onchain modules. The Sandbox comes with a set of pre-built components which are designed to be re-usable and speed up the development process. It also comes with a set of helper utilities that abstract away the complexities of using ERC-4337 and modules.

<Callout type="warning">
  The Sandbox is in active development and is subject to breaking changes. If
  you spot a bug, please take out an issue and we will fix it as soon as we can.
