# Using ERC-4337

The Sandbox provides a complete abstraction of the ERC-4337 flows. This page gives an overview of the different helper utilities that enable this and how you can use them.

## Creating and executing a UserOperation

To create and execute a UserOperation, you can use the [`useCreateUserOp`](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sandbox/blob/main/src/domains/UserOperation/hooks/useCreateUserOp.ts) hook. The hook can be used like a regular React hook:

```javascript copy
const createUserOp = useCreateUserOp();
```

The main argument for creating a UserOperation is the `actions` array. It consists of a list of `ExecuteAction` objects, which have the following parameters:

```typescript
type ExecuteAction = {
  target: Address;
  value: BigInt;
  callData: Hex;
};
```

The `createUserOp` object has a `mutateAsync` method that can be used to create a UserOperation:

```javascript copy
userOp = await createUserOp.mutateAsync({
  name: `Display Name in the UI`,
  actions,
});
```

Optionally, you can also provide additional parameters to the `mutateAsync` method:

- `account`: The account to use for the UserOperation. If not provided, the active account will be used. (Type: [`Account`](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sandbox/blob/main/src/domains/Account/Account.ts))
- `validator`: The validator to use for the UserOperation. If not provided, the active validator will be used. (Type: [`Validator`](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sandbox/blob/main/src/domains/Module/Module.ts))
- `callback`: A callback function that will be called when the UserOperation is executed. (Type: `() => void`)
