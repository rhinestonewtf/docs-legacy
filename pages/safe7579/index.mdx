# Safe7579

**An ERC-7579 adapter for Safe accounts**

Safe7579 provides full ERC-4337 and ERC-7579 compliance to Safe accounts by serving as the Safe's FallbackHandler and an enabled module. This setup allows Safe accounts to utilize all ERC-7579 modules. The launchpad is used to facilitate the setup of new safes with Safe7579 using the EntryPoint factory.

The Safe7579 Adapter allows Safe accounts to access:

- **ERC-4337**: Using the ERC-4337 flow for gas abstraction and a permissionless mempool.
- **Validation Logic**: Modular validation logic for Safe transactions, such as passkeys or weighted multi-sigs.
- **Execution Logic**: Modular execution logic for Safe transactions, such as conditional execution based on call returns.
- **Hook Behavior**: Enforcing conditions or executing logic pre- or post-execution, such as spending limits or virtual cold storage.
