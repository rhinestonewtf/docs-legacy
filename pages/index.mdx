### What are Smart Account Modules

Modules are self-contained smart contracts that extend a smart account's feature set. This creates a new paradigm for developers to access the programmable validation and execution of smart accounts, unlocking new product capabilities without compromising user self-sovereignty.

There are four types of modules today:

- **Validators:** Allow developers to modify how transactions are authenticated or what can be authorized against an account. This can unlock powerful features like session keys or quantum-proof signatures.
- **Executors:** Allow developers to create executions on an account with custom logic. This, for example, can unlock portfolio management products like a take profit or stop loss feature on a DeFi platform. [ZK Email](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/private-email-recovery-with-zk-email-3405ce4d866e) is a novel example of how powerful and versatile an executor can be.
- **Hooks:** Allow developers to augment a smart account's execution flow by hooking in pre- or post-execution and enforcing conditions or any custom logic. A simple example is a spending limit.
- **Fallbacks:** Extend the account logic to add more functionality. For example, this can allow an account to be compatible with new module types in the future.
