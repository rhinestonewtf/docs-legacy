# Getting started

The easiest way to use the Rhinestone Orchestrator is to use the Orchestrator SDK. The Orchestrator SDK is built on top of [viem](https://viem.sh/), a typesafe, modern Ethereum library. Apart from that, the SDK is standalone and can be used without any other dependencies and in any javascript or typescript project.

## Installation

Install viem as a peer dependency and then install the Orchestrator SDK:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i viem @rhinestone/orchestrator-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```typescript copy
todo
```
