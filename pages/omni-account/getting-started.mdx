# Getting started

The easiest way to use the Rhinestone Orchestrator is to use the Orchestrator SDK. It is a modern typescript environment that makes it easy to interact with the Orchestrator to create a user account, get a meta intent path, submit a meta intent, get its' status and more.

If you want to interact with the Orchestrator directly, you can use the [Orchestrator API](/todo).

## Installation

Install the orchestator SDK using a package manager of your choice.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @rhinestone/orchestrator-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```typescript copy
// create the orchestrator client to start interacting with the service
const orchestrator = getOrchestrator(orchestratorApiKey);

// create a new user account
const userId = await orchestrator.createUserAccount(
  accountAddress,
  [firstChain.id, secondChain.id]
);
```
