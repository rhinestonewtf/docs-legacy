# Validators

Validators are smart account modules that are called during the validation phase of a UserOperation. This means that their primary function is to verify the signature of a UserOperation and determine whether it is valid and should be executed.

## Validator restrictions

### Storage access

ERC-4337 restricts storage access during the validation phase. As a results, the only storage slots that a validator can access are slots that are accessed through a mapping of the address of the account to non-dynamic data. We’re working on solutions that allow developers to use dynamic data in validators. Read more [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#storage-associated-with-an-address).

### Forbidden Opcodes
