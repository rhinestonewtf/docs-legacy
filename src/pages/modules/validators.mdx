# Validators

Validators are smart account modules that are called during the validation phase of a UserOperation. This means that their primary function is to verify the signature of a UserOperation and determine whether it is valid and should be executed.

### Storage access

ERC-4337 restricts storage access during the validation phase. As a results, the only storage slots that a validator can access are slots that are accessed through a mapping of the address of the account to non-dynamic data. Weâ€™re working on solutions that allow developers to use dynamic data in validators.
