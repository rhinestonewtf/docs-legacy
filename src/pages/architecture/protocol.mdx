# The Protocol

The in-depth technical details of the protocol are coming soon. Including the white paper!

At the core of the World ID Protocol is the use of [Semaphore](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/). Semaphore is a zk-SNARK based privacy protocol that allows for the creation of anonymous credential systems developed by the Ethereum Foundation. The World ID Protocol uses Semaphore to create distinct anonymity sets for [proof of personhood](/id/proof-of-personhood).

Currently, personhood credentials are handled as separate Sempahore instances. That means that each credential has its own anonymity set, and is only a list of verified credential holders. No other information is attached on-chain related to the credential (e.g. no biometric information is attached for the biometric credential, or no information about a phone number is attached to a phone credential).
