# Overview


The Rhinestone Registry is instrumental in delivering enhanced user security, greater wallet extensibility, and improved UX to the Ethereum ecosystem. The registry aims to verify the legitimacy and security of independently built smart account modules for deployment and use across any integrated smart account. The interactions between the Rhinestone Registry, SchemaResolvers, and Hashi form the backbone of this system, paving the way for interoperability and composability amongst different attestation protocols and solutions.
