# Deploying modules

This tutorial will walk you through deploying any of your modules. Simultaneously, this will also register your module on the [Module Registry](/registry) in order to make it available to users.

This tutorial uses Foundry, a toolchain to simplify and speed up smart contract development. If you are not familiar with Foundry, feel free to check out [their docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

<Note>
	If you do not have foundry installed, run the following command and follow the onscreen instructions: ```bash curl
	-L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash ```
</Note>

## Installation

1. Get started with ModuleKit by using our template or adding it into an existing foundry project:

<CodeGroup title="Installation">

    ```bash {{ title: "template" }}
    git clone https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/module-template.git
    cd module-template
    forge install
    ````

    ```bash {{ title: "existing foundry project" }}
    forge install rhinestonewtf/modulekit
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Deploying the module

In this section, we will deploy the module.

2. Open the file `script/DeployModule.s.sol` and change the following code:

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = type(ValidatorTemplate).creationCode;
bytes memory deployParams = "";
bytes memory data = "";
```

Change `ValidatorTemplate` to the name of your module and `deployParams` to the parameters you want to pass to the constructor (if any). Finally, change `data` to the data you want to be stored additionally on the Registry (you will likely want to leave this empty for now).

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```shell
PK=[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]
```

3. Replace the following variables in the command below and then run it in your terminal:

-   `RPC_URL` is the URL of the RPC node you want to use to broadcast the transaction.
-   `SENDER_ADDRESS` is the address of the account you want to use to deploy the module (the address of the private key you added to your `.env` file).

```shell
forge script script/DeployModule.s.sol:DeployModuleScript --rpc-url [RPC_URL] --sender [SENDER_ADDRESS] --broadcast
```

4. You should see the following message:

```bash {{title: "response"}}
Module deployed at: 0x...
```

### Congratulations, you just deployed your first module!
