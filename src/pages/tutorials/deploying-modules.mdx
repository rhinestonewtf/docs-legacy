# Deploying modules

This tutorial will walk you through deploying any of your modules. Simultaneously, this will also register your module on the [Module Registry](/registry) in order to make it available to users.

This tutorial uses Foundry, a toolchain to simplify and speed up smart contract development. If you are not familiar with Foundry, feel free to check out [their docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

<Note>
	If you do not have foundry installed, run the following command and follow the onscreen instructions: ```bash curl
	-L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash ```
</Note>

## Installation

1. Get started with ModuleKit by using our template or adding it into an existing foundry project:

<CodeGroup title="Installation">

    ```bash {{ title: "template" }}
    git clone https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/module-template.git
    cd module-template
    forge install
    ````

    ```bash {{ title: "existing foundry project" }}
    forge install rhinestonewtf/modulekit
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Deploying the module

In this section, we will deploy the module.

2. Create the script

3. Add the following code:

```solidity
tbd
```

4. Configure the network etc

5. Run `forge script` to run the tests and ensure that they pass. You should see the following message:

```bash {{title: "response"}}
tbd
```

**Congratulations, you just deployed your first module!**
