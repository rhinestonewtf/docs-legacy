# Getting started

The fastest way to start building a smart account module is by using ModuleKit, a development kit for building and testing modules. This guide will walk you through installing ModuleKit and setting yourself up to start building innovative modules.

ModuleKit is based on Foundry, a toolchain to simplify and speed up smart contract development. If you are not familiar with Foundry, feel free to check out [their docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

<Note>
	If you do not have foundry installed, run the following command and follow the onscreen instructions: ```bash curl
	-L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash ```
</Note>

## Installation

1. Install ModuleKit by using our template or adding it into an existing foundry project:

<CodeGroup title="Installation">

    ```bash {{ title: "template" }}
    git clone https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/module-template.git
    cd module-template
    forge install
    ````

    ```bash {{ title: "existing foundry project" }}
    forge install rhinestonewtf/modulekit
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Building a module

The ModuleKit makes building a module a straightforward process. Simply create a new contract in `src/[MODULE_TYPE]` and inherit from the correct interface for that module type. Learn more about module types and their interfaces [here](/modulekit/modules#module-types). Apart from that, the only thing you need to do is adhere to the interface by implementing all required functions and,if building a validator, adhere to the [additional requirements](/modulekit/modules#module-types). For hands-on guides to building modules, visit the [tutorials](/tutorials) section of the docs.

## Testing a module

The ModuleKit provides an end-to-end testing framework to make it easy for you to test your modules and abstract away all the complexities. To start testing a module simply create a `.t.sol` file under `test/[MODULE_TYPE]` and inherit from the `RhinestoneModuleKit` as well as Foundry's `Test`. Learn more about testing using Foundry [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests). Now you can use the provided [helper utilities](/modulekit#helper-utilities) in order to simplify and accelerate the testing of your module. For hands-on guides to testing modules, visit the [tutorials](/tutorials) section of the docs.
