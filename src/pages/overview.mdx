# Overview

Rhinestone is building a platform to enable a secure ecosystem of onchain modules for modular accounts and, with it, permissionless wallet innovation. Modular accounts are smart accounts that are easily extensible for both users and developers. These docs will arm developers with the right knowledge, tools and resources to build modules, and pair them with unique UI components to then be deployed within integrated wallets via the module marketplace. We also provide developers with turnkey monetisation models in order to drive revenue back to developers.

## Components
