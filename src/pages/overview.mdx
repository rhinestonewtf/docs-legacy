# Overview

Rhinestone is focused on building infrastructure to enable a secure ecosystem of modular smart accounts (also known as smart contract wallets) and, with it, permissionless wallet innovation. Modular smart accounts are accounts that are easily extensible for both users and developers and are thus more customisable and flexible than static accounts.

## Components

In order to bring about this modular ecosystem, there are multiple key pieces that still need to be built. These include:

1. A module registry that allows developers to register their modules, auditors to attest to their security and users to easily add them to their account
2. Developer tooling to streamline the process of building, testing and deploying modules for different smart account implementations
3. A wallet application (and wallet SDK) that allows users to easily customise their account and act as a distribution and monetisation platform for developers (coming soon)
