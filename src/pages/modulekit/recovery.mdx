# Recovery

Recovery modules are smart account modules that can reset the storage of validators through a different process. Since validators are crucial to the functioning of a smart account, they also present a big attack surface through which to attempt to compromise the account. Thus, users can use different kinds of recovery mechanisms to ensure that they are able to reset validators if they get compromised or a user loses access to their account.

## Building a recovery module

In order to build a compliant recovery module you need to ensure that it:

-   Inherits from the `IRecovery` interface.
-   Implements the following functions:
    -   `validateRecoveryProof(bytes calldata recoveryProof)`
    -   `getRecoverySchema()`

The template for a compliant executor (without actual logic) looks like this:

```solidity
contract RecoveryTemplate is IRecovery {
    function validateRecoveryProof(bytes calldata recoveryProof) external override returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }

    function getRecoverySchema() external view returns (string memory) {
        return "";
    }
}
```
