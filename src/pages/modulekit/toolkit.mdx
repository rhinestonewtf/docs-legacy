# Toolkit

## Building modules

### Interfaces

-   `ValidatorBase`: Interface for Validators to inherit from.
-   `ExecutorBase`: Interface for Executors to inherit from.

### Templates

-   [Validator](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/module-template/blob/main/src/validators/ValidatorTemplate.sol): Template implementation for Validators.
-   [Executor](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/module-template/blob/main/src/executors/ExecutorTemplate.sol): Template implementation for Executors.

### Conditions

Executors can be extended to become conditional executors, by validating conditions for when the executor should be executed using the `ComposableConditionManager`. The ModuleKit currently has conditions for:

-   Gas price
-   Token price

... and more to come! View all conditions [here](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/modulekit/blob/main/src/modulekit/conditions).

Users can select different conditions and in order to support any existing condition, the executor needs to call the `ComposableConditionManager`.

```solidity
...
import { ComposableConditionManager, ConditionConfig } from "modulekit/core/ComposableCondition.sol";

contract GasPriceExecutor is ExecutorBase {
    ...

    mapping(address account => ConditionConfig[] conditions) conditions;

    function execute(address account) external {
        if (!ComposableConditionManager(manager).checkCondition(account, conditions[account])) revert NotExecutable();
        ...
    }

    ...
}
```

### Integrations

Integrations are Solidity libraries that can easily be integrated into modules to simplify the developer experience for common use cases. The ModuleKit currently has integrations for:

-   Yearn
-   ERC-4626 Vaults
-   ChainLink
-   Uniswap

... and more to come! View all integrations [here](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/modulekit/blob/main/src/modulekit/integrations).

To use an integration, simply import it into your module and call the functions that you need.

```solidity
...
import {YearnWithdraw} from "modulekit/modulekit/integrations/yearn/YearnWidthdraw.sol";

contract YearnModule is ExecutorBase {
    ...

    function withdrawFromYearn(IExecutorManager manager, address account, address yToken) external {
        ...
        YearnWithdraw.withdraw(manager, account, yToken);
    }

    ...
}
```

## Testing modules

### Execute ERC-4337 flow

Execute an ERC-4337 transaction on the account with and `address` target and `bytes` calldata.

```solidity
instance.exec4337(address target, bytes memory data);
```

Execute an ERC-4337 transaction on the account with and `address` target, a `uint256` value and `bytes` calldata.

```solidity
instance.exec4337(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory data);
```

Execute an ERC-4337 transaction on the account with and `address` target, a `uint256` value, `bytes` calldata and `bytes` signature.

<CodeGroup>

```solidity {{ title: 'Safe' }}
instance.exec4337(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory data, uint8 operation, bytes memory signature);
```

```solidity {{ title: 'Biconomy' }}
instance.exec4337(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory data, bytes memory signature);
```

</CodeGroup>

### Add and remove modules to the account

Add a validator to the account by providing the `address` of the validator.

```solidity
instance.addValidator(address validator);
```

Remove a validator to the account by providing the `address` of the validator.

```solidity
instance.removeValidator(address validator);
```

Add an executor to the account by providing the `address` of the executor.

```solidity
instance.addExecutor(address executor);
```

Remove an executor to the account by providing the `address` of the executor.

```solidity
instance.removeExecutor(address executor);
```

Add a fallback handler to the account by providing the `bytes4` function signature, a `bool` whether the method is static (view) or not and the `address` of the handler.

```solidity
instance.addFallback(bytes4 handleFunctionSig, bool isStatic, address handler);
```

### ERC-4337 utils

Get the hash of the UserOperation in order to, for example, sign it.

<CodeGroup>

    ```solidity {{ title: 'Safe' }}
    instance.getUserOpHash(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory callData, uint8 operation);
    ```

    ```solidity {{ title: 'Biconomy' }}
    instance.getUserOpHash(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory callData);
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Deploying modules

Deterministically deploy a module using the `CREATE2` opcode, by providing the `bytes` creation code of the module, `bytes` constructor parameters for the module, `bytes32` salt vakue to create uniqueness and `bytes` additional data to be stored on the Module Registry.

```solidity
deployModule(bytes memory code, bytes memory deployParams, bytes32 salt, bytes memory data);
```

Deterministically deploy a module using `CREATE3`, by providing the `bytes` creation code of the module, `bytes` constructor parameters for the module, `bytes32` salt vakue to create uniqueness and `bytes` additional data to be stored on the Module Registry.

```solidity
deployModuleCreate3(bytes memory code, bytes memory deployParams, bytes32 salt, bytes memory data);
```

Deploy a module using an external factory contract, by providing the `address` of the factory, `bytes` encoded calldata to be sent to the factory and `bytes` additional data to be stored on the Module Registry.

```solidity
deployModuleViaFactory(address factory, bytes memory callOnFactory, bytes memory data);
```
