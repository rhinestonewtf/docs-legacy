# Overview

<Note title="FYI">
	We are still brainstorming a name for this entity, [Registry] is a temporary placeholder. We'd appreciate any

## Introduction {{ className: 'mt-0 uppercase text-sm text-neutral-400 font-normal', anchor: false }}

The [Registry] plays a crucial role in advancing Ethereum's account abstraction capabilities. Modular account abstraction provides a platform for open innovation within the wallet stack. However, it also introduces several new security concerns and attack vectors.

The goal of the [Registry] is to unleash open innovation within modular smart accounts through a decentralised trust delegation mechanism (as discussed in our recent [blog post](https://mirror.xyz/konradkopp.eth/7Q3TrMFgx2VbZRKa7UEaisIMjimpMABiqGYo00T9egA)). The [Registry] looks to solve these new security concerns by facilitating an open, permissionless platform for registering, verifying, and propagating the security attestations of smart account modules across various EVM chains. This allows users to easily verify the security of a smart account module before installation and thus allows smart account providers to securely tap into a marketplace for third-party modules.

To prevent vendor-lock-in and module fragmentation, the [Registry] is a public good that is open, permissionless and free to use and build on top of.

<Note title="FYI">
	The [Registry] is currently in **alpha** and active development. Do not use the contracts in production.

The video above is a walkthrough of the [Registry] and its current capabilities. As explained, the interactions between the [Registry], SchemaResolvers, and Hashi form the backbone of this system, paving the way for interoperability and composability amongst different attestation protocols and solutions. The graph below shows these connections and interdependencies in detail.
