# Overview

## Introduction

The goal of the Module Registry is to unlock open innovation within modular smart accounts through a decentralised trust delegation mechanism (as discussed in our [blog post](https://mirror.xyz/konradkopp.eth/7Q3TrMFgx2VbZRKa7UEaisIMjimpMABiqGYo00T9egA)). It looks to solve the new security concerns that arise from modularising smart accounts by allowing trusted entities, like auditors, to make statements about the security of smart account modules. Users can then query these statements on-chain in order to be sure that a module they are about to install or use is still secure.

Specifically, the Module Registry is a list of (security) statements about modules, which we call attestations. These attestations are made by trusted entities, called attesters, and are stored on-chain. The Module Registry also provides a gas efficient way for users to query these attestations on-chain in order to use them to make decisions about whether to install or use a module. The Module Registry is a public good that is open, permissionless and free to use and build on top of.

<Note title="FYI">
	The Module Registry is currently in **alpha** and active development. Do not use the contracts in production.
