# Sign In With Worldcoin

To better serve all classes of applications, World ID can now be used as an OpenID Connect Provider (Identity Provider, IdP, OP). We support many of the same integrations that developers are already familiar with (Auth0, Cloudflare, etc.). The following diagram outlines the general authentication flow for an integrating app:

<Fence className="bg-gray-50">![A diagram showcasing the main authentication flow](/images/docs/id/sign-in.svg)</Fence>

If your app already supports OIDC, simply add our [discovery document](/api/sign-in-reference#open-id-connect-discovery) as an authentication option. You can read more about our implementation in [`/authorize`](#authentication) and [`/token`](/api/sign-in-reference#exchange-code).

## Registration

Before OIDC authentication can take place, developers must register their applications with Worldcoin. This is a one-time action. There are two ways to accomplish this:

1. Create a new application on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org)
2. Use the `/register` endpoint, request body details can be [found here](/api/sign-in-reference#register-app)

During registration, you will need to provide the following values:

-   `redirect_uris`: **Required**, list of approved websites the user can be redirected to after successful authentication.
-   `client_name`: **Optional**, the name of the application that's displayed to users
-   `logo_url`: **Optional**, the logo of the application that's displayed to users
-   `application_type`: **Optional**, one of "web" or "mobile". Defaults to "web"
-   `grant_types`: **Optional**, the type of flows this application will use. Can include "authorization_code", "implicit", or "hybrid". Defaults to "authorization_code"
-   `response_type`: **Optional**, the response type expected by the application. Can include any of "code", "token", or "id_token". Defaults to "id_token"
    -   `code`: The [`/authorize`](#authentication) endpoint will include an authorization code that can be exchanged for an access token and/or ID token on the [`/token`](/api/sign-in-reference#exchange-code) endpoint. Best suited for web/mobile applications with dedicated backends, where security is the highest priority.
    -   `token`: The [`/authorize`](#authentication) endpoint will include an access token, which can be used to fetch user information from the [`/userinfo`](/api/sign-in-reference#get-user-info) and [`/introspect`](/api/sign-in-reference#introspect) endpoints. Best suited for low-risk applications, and client-only/SPAs where a `client_secret` cannot be concealed.
    -   `id_token`: **Recommended for most applications.** The [`/authorize`](#authentication) endpoint will include a signed JWT containing information about the user, including the unique `sub` claim (otherwise known as the [nullifier hash](/idkit/reference#response)). Provides simple user authentication, while keeping the amount of user data shared to a minimum. Best for privacy-conscious apps.

<Note>
	All redirect URIs must be over HTTPS, and contain no port numbers or URL fragments. `localhost` can be used on
	staging apps for testing, but will not work on production apps.
</Note>

After registration is complete, you will have a valid `app_id` that will be needed for every other step in the authentication process. This value is equivalent to `client_id` from the [OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest)

## Flows

World ID supports the [authorization code](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth), [implicit](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth), and [hybrid](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) flows from the OIDC spec. Applications can use any one of these flows to authenticate users.

_Generally_, applications should implement the authorization code flow, as it is more secure than the implicit flow. Applications without backend servers (that may be running purely client-side) are more suited to implicit authentication.

## Authentication

Authentication begins with a request to the `/authorize` endpoint.

When using the native Sign In with Worldcoin page, most of the OIDC process is handled for you. You can begin the authentication cycle by redirecting your users to:

```
https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize?client_id={app_id}&response_type={code|token|id_token}&redirect_uri={encoded_redirect_url}&state={state_value}&nonce={nonce_value}
```

Example values could be:

{/* cSpell:disable */}

-   `client_id`: obtained from the Developer Portal or `/register` endpoint (example: `app_lshSNnaJfdt6Sohu6YAA`).
-   `response_type`: response type as specified in OIDC spec, remember to URL encode (example: `code%20id_token`).
-   `redirect_uri`: where the user is redirected upon successful authentication. Must be on the approved redirect URI list which can always be updated in the Developer Portal (example: `https%3A%2F%2Fapp.example.com%2Flogin`).
-   `state`: unique value used to track a user's session (example: `session_102030405060708090`).
-   `nonce`: random value to prevent replay attacks (example: `z-dkEmoy_ujfk7B8uTiQpp`).

{/* cSpell:enable */}

The user will then authenticate with their World ID via the World app. Once successfully authorized, the user is redirected back to your application. The redirect URL will contain a number of values, depending on the flow you are using.

### Redirect Responses

If using the default authorization code flow, the redirect URL will contain the following params:

-   `code`: An authorization code that can be exchanged for an ID token
-   `state`: The optional state value passed to the `/authorize` endpoint

If you received a response containing an _authorization code_, you must exchange it for an ID token on the `/token` endpoint. Request details can be [seen here](/api/sign-in-reference#exchange-code).

If using implicit flow, the redirect URL will contain the following params:

-   `id_token`: A signed JWT identifying the user, and any requested scope information

<Note type="caution">ID tokens must always be verified, and should not be blindly accepted!</Note>

To verify an ID token, fetch the public key from the `/jwks` endpoint. You can read more about this process at the [Auth0 blog](https://auth0.com/blog/navigating-rs256-and-jwks/) or [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/), but one example method could be:

```ts
import * as jose from 'jose'

const verifyJwt = (token: string) => {
	const JWKS = jose.createRemoteJWKSet(new URL('https://id.worldcoin.org/jwks.json'))

	const { payload, header } = await jose.jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
		issuer: 'https://id.worldcoin.org',
		aud: 'app_lshSNnaJfdt6Sohu6YAA',
	})

	return payload
}

verifyJwt('eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp.eyAs.XVCJ9...')
```
