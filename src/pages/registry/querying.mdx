# Querying the Registry

In order for a smart account to check the security of a Module, it will need to query the Registry either during the installation of the Module or during the execution of the Module (or both). The Registry provides a simple interface for querying attestations, which is compliant with [ERC-7484](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7484).

## Querying Attestations

A smart account adapter (as defined by ERC-7484) can quey the Registry using one of two functions:

`check` - Returns the timestamp of the attestation for a given Module and attester. It also verifies that the attestation exists and has not been revoked and reverts otherwise.

```solidity
function check(
    address module,
    address attester
)
    public
    view
    returns (uint256 attestedAt);
```

`checkN` - Returns an array the timestamps of the attestations for a given Module and list of attesters. Optionally, it can be supplied with a threshold. It verifies that an attestation exists and has not been revoked by every attester in the list and reverts otherwise. If a threshold is supplied, it verifies that the number of attestations is greater than or equal to the threshold and reverts otherwise.

```solidity
function checkN(
    address module,
    address[] calldata attesters,
    uint256 threshold
)
    external
    view
    returns (uint256[] memory attestedAtArray);
```

Additionally, the Registry also exposes a function that is not mandated by ERC-7484: `checkNUnsafe`. This function is identical to `checkN` except that it does not revert if an attestation by an attester in the list does not exist or has been revoked. Instead, it only counts them as a non-existent attestation and returns the timestamp of the attestation as 0. As the name says, this function is less safe than `checkN` and should only be used if there is sufficient reason, such as when an adapter wants to perform custom validation logic.

```solidity
function checkNUnsafe(
    address module,
    address[] calldata attesters,
    uint256 threshold
)
    external
    view
    returns (uint256[] memory attestedAtArray);
```
