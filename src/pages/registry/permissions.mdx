# Permissions

The Module Registry is a permissionless and ownerless system. Despite this, the system maintains certain controls to ensure the integrity of the data. The owner of a schema (the entity that created it) can update the resolver address of the schema. Additionally, attestors that created attestations have the power to revoke the attestation in the future.
