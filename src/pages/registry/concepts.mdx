# Core Concepts

The [Rhinestone Registry] is designed as an open, free, and permissionless entity. Itsâ€™ architecture enables the registry to manage and coordinate various types of smart account modules, allowing smart accounts to tap into an ecosystem of third-party modules. It promotes a decentralized, collaborative environment, where entities can share, validate, and verify smart account modules across chains and are incentivised to contribute to the same entity rather than building similar systems in parallel. This allows for "module liquidity" to accumulate in a single entity and thus allows for greater and more easily attainable interoperability for all actors involved.
