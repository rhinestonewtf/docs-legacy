# Core Concepts

The Module Registry architecture enables it to manage and coordinate various types of smart account modules and allows smart accounts to tap into an ecosystem of modules built by third-party developers. It promotes a decentralized, collaborative environment, where entities can share, validate, and verify smart account modules across chains and are incentivised to contribute to the same entity rather than building similar systems in parallel. This allows for "module liquidity" to accumulate in a single place and thus allows for greater and more easily attainable interoperability for all actors involved.
