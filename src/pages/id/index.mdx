# Overview

World ID is a privacy-first identity protocol that brings global [proof of personhood](/id/proof-of-personhood) to the internet. It allows verified users to prove they are a unique person, and optionally prove they are performing a given action only once. This is accomplished with a combination of blockchain technology and [zero-knowledge proofs](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs) (ZKP).

## How does it work?

A user's World ID lives in their device, and only in their device. The user installs a compatible identity wallet (such as the [World App](https://worldcoin.org/download)). A unique and random private key is generated on-device, where it is securely stored. Identity wallets may incorporate their own recovery mechanisms, however Protocol-level recovery is being implemented soon.

From the user's private key, a public _identity commitment_ is generated and published on-chain (currently Polygon), which acts at the source of truth for the protocol. An identity commitment is analogous to a public key in an asymmetric key-pair, or a wallet address, but in the World ID protocol this value is not broadly shared.The private key is used as input to each World ID verification, specifically as part of the [ZKP](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs).

The user's wallet (e.g. World App) generates a ZKP for every verification a user makes. Verifications cannot be linked across applications or actions, which means that the user's privacy is cryptographically protected.

After a user verifies, a _nullifier hash_ is returned to the application. The nullifier hash is the user's unique identifier for the application (and the action, if using [Anonymous Actions](/id/anonymous-actions)). Nullifiers are unique to the application, and cannot be linked to other nullifiers from the same person, even resistant to colluding applications.

## Developer Portal

It is highly recommended to first register any applications in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org). The portal provides a simple UI to manage applications, actions, and user metrics. The portal is the easiest way to verify the proofs returned by [IDKit](/idkit), and performs much of the on-chain lookups for the integrating application.

Additionally, those familiar with OpenID Connect (OIDC) will be able to use World ID as their [Identity Provider](/id/sign-in). We support all of the most common integrations, such as Auth0 and Cloudflare.
