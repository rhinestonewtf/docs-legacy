Building infrastructure for modular smart accounts. {{ className: 'text-2xl' }}

## Introduction {{ className: 'mt-0 uppercase text-sm text-neutral-400 font-normal', anchor: false }}

After multiple rejected or stalled proposals to add native support for smart contract wallets (smart accounts) to Ethereum, ERC-4337 has been accepted as the (interim) standard to implement Account Abstraction (AA) without protocol level changes to the EVM.

Over the last few months, there has been a surge in activity in a subset of AA which revolves around the modularization of these smart accounts to make them more easily extensible for both users and developers. This general approach is termed modular account abstraction and rhinestone is building tools and infrastructure to propell this ecosystem forward.

## Components

In order to properly bring about this modular ecosystem, there are a couple of key pieces that still need to be built. Currently we are focusing on the following:

1. A module registry that allows developers to register their modules and users to easily and securely add them into their account.
2. Developer tooling to make it easy to build and test modules for different modular account implementations. **(Coming soon)**
3. A wallet reference implementation that allows users to try out what a modular account could look like and do, as well as being a testing ground for module developers. **(Coming soon)**
