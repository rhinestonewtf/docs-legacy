# Rhinestone Registry {{ className: 'uppercase text-5xl' }}


The Rhinestone Registry smart contract is a crucial element in advancing Ethereum's account abstraction capabilities. Modular account abstraction (or modular smart accounts) provides a platform for open innovation within the wallet stack. However, it also introduces a number of new security concerns and attack vectors. The goal of the Rhinestone Registry is to unleash open innovation within modular smart accounts through a decentralised trust delegation mechanism (as discussed in our recent blog post). The Rhinestone Registry looks to solve these new security concerns by facilitating an open, permissionless platform for registering, verifying, and propagating the security attestations of smart account modules across various EVM chains.

<Note title="FYI">
  Rhinestone Registry is currenty  in **Beta** and in active development. Do not use contracts in production.
