# [Rhinestone Registry] {{ className: 'text-5xl' }}

The [Rhinestone Registry] (name pending) smart contract is a crucial element in advancing Ethereum's account abstraction capabilities. Modular account abstraction provides a platform for open innovation within the wallet stack. However, it also introduces a number of new security concerns and attack vectors. The goal of the [Rhinestone Registry] is to unleash open innovation within modular smart accounts through a decentralised trust delegation mechanism (as discussed in our recent [blog post](https://mirror.xyz/konradkopp.eth/7Q3TrMFgx2VbZRKa7UEaisIMjimpMABiqGYo00T9egA)). The [Rhinestone Registry] looks to solve these new security concerns by facilitating an open, permissionless platform for registering, verifying, and propagating the security attestations of smart account modules across various EVM chains.

<Note title="FYI">
	[Rhinestone Registry] is currenty in **Alpha** and in active development. Do not use the contracts in production.
