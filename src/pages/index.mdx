Permissionless wallet innovation {{ className: 'text-2xl' }}

Account abstraction is a powerful tool for web3 builders. Smart contract accounts (or smart accounts) allows for programmable validity (allow X to do Y) and execution (do Z and then Y if A occurs), which has brought about heightened wallet security (e.g. multi-sig) and improved dapp experiences (e.g. session keys or multi-call). However, access to this new programmable platform has been limited to the core teams working on smart accounts and their accompanying UI (the wallet).

Modular account abstraction changes the game and allows any developer to build self-contained components that extend the onchain functionality of the user’s account. We believe this will establish smart accounts as a new platform for product innovation, disrupting the wallet space in the same way the iPhone disrupted the mobile phone industry.

At Rhinestone, we’re building a platform that facilitates module development, from quick start frameworks and third-party tooling, all the way through to guided audits and deployment to the user’s account. We provide distribution through the [smart app store] and turn key business modules through monetization tooling.

Our role doesn’t just start and begin with on-chain innovation. We believe that in order to bring [smart apps] to life, developers need access to UI components and sandboxed areas within the wallet application in order to marry on-chain innovation with tailored (and native) UX.
