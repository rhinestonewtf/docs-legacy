# JS Reference

Here you will find information about all the configuration options and parameters that IDKit supports.

## Parameters

The following parameters can be passed as props to the `IDKitWidget` component.

### Required Parameters

<Properties>
	<Property name="app_id" type="string">
		Unique identifier for the app verifying the action. This should be the action ID obtained from the [Developer
		Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
	</Property>
	<Property name="action" type="string">
		Identifier for the action the user is performing. Should be left blank for [Sign in with
		Worldcoin](/id/sign-in).
	</Property>
	<Property name="onSuccess" type="function">
		Function to trigger when verification is successful. Should receive a single parameter of type `ISuccessResult`
		which contains the proof details.
	</Property>
</Properties>

### Optional Parameters

<Properties>
	<Property name="handleVerify" type="function">
		Called after the proof is returned from the World App, but before showing the success screen. Throwing in this
		screen will show the user a custom error. Used to perform additional validation when needed.
	</Property>
	<Property name="enableTelemetry" type="boolean">
		Whether opt-in telemetry is enabled. Very few events are sent, with no PII to help improve the project.
	</Property>
	<Property name="theme" type='"light" | "dark"'>
		The theme to apply to the widget's UI.
	</Property>
	<Property name="signal" type="string">
		For use when validating proofs on-chain. Read more on [the On-chain section](/advanced/on-chain).
	</Property>
	<Property name="action_description" type="string">
		The description of the specific action (shown to users in World App). **Only recommended for actions created
		on-the-fly.**
	</Property>
	<Property name="credential_types" type="string[]">
		An array of credential types to allow for verification. Will accept any combination of `orb` & `phone`. Defaults
		to `orb`. **TypeScript apps can use the `CredentialType` enum.**
	</Property>
</Properties>

## Components

### `IDKitWidget`

The `IDKitWidget` component is the main component that renders the World ID widget. It should be mounted in your React app and passed the relevant parameters. Accepts a function as a child that receives a `open` function to open the widget.

### `SignInWithWorldID`

The `SignInWithWorldID` component is a wrapper around the `IDKitWidget` component that renders the World ID widget with the correct parameters for [Sign in with Worldcoin](/id/sign-in).

### `SignInButton`

The `SignInButton` component is a styled and animated button, for use with [Sign in with Worldcoin](/id/sign-in). It is the default when using the `SignInWithWorldID` component, but also exported separately for use with custom components.

## Hooks

### `useIDKit`

The `useIDKit` hook allows you to programmatically open the IDKit widget without mounting any buttons on screen. Note that you still need to mount the component for this to work.

```jsx focus=1,3,6,11
import { useIDKit } from '@worldcoin/idkit'

const { open, setOpen } = useIDKit()

useEffect(() => {
	setOpen(true)
}, [])

return (
	<div>
		<IDKitWidget app_id="..." action="..." />
	</div>
)
```

## Methods

### .init()

The `.init()` method is the main initialization method used for vanilla JS apps. It should be called to start up IDKit and configure the widget.

**.init(parameters) => void**

**Example:**

{/* cSpell:disable */}

```js
idkit.init({
	action: 'my_action',
	app_id: 'app_lshSNnaJfdt6Sohu6YAA',
})
```

{/* cSpell:enable */}

### .open()

The `.open()` method is used to open the widget. It should be called after the `.init()` method.

**Example:**

```js
idkit.open()
```

## Response

Upon successful completion of the World ID flow, you will receive a response object. This response object of type `ISuccessResult` has the following attributes. **Normally, you will forward these parameters to your backend or smart contract for verification.**

<Properties>
	<Property name="merkle_root" type="string">
		This is the hash pointer to the root of the Merkle tree that proves membership of the user's identity in the
		list of identities verified by the Orb. ABI encoded.
	</Property>
	<Property name="nullifier_hash" type="string">
		Essentially the user's unique identifier for your app (and specific action if using Anonymous actions). ABI
		encoded.
	</Property>
	<Property name="proof" type="string">
		The Zero-knowledge proof of the verification. ABI encoded.
	</Property>
	<Property name="credential_type" type='"orb" | "phone"'>
		Either `orb` or `phone`.
	</Property>
</Properties>
