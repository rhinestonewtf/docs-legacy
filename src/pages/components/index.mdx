# Components

These docs aim to outline the different components of the modular account abstraction ecosystem that we are researching and building at rhinestone. On a high level, all the components in this ecosystem are the account, modules, registry, UIs and developer tooling. These components may not be the only parts required to make this ecosystem function in the long term, but at least for now they adequately encompass the different areas that teams are focusing their research and development efforts on. To read up more about these components, take a look at our recent [blog post](https://mirror.xyz/konradkopp.eth/7Q3TrMFgx2VbZRKa7UEaisIMjimpMABiqGYo00T9egA) on the topic. Below, you'll find the components that we are currently actively building at rhinestone:
