## What?

The bot problems in social media have been around for years now. Bots not only undermine the network and the overall quality, but it can lead to misinformation, manipulation and other adverse effects. Adding an anonymous proof of personhood layer to any social media can significantly diminish this adverse effects (particularly at scale), while enhancing the overall quality of the network.

## Applications & Problems Solved

### Bot Protection {{style: { marginTop: 0, marginBottom: 0}}}

### Improved engagement {{style: { marginTop: 0, marginBottom: 0}}}

Content from humans prioritized. This can be further coupled with a continuous scale (e.g. content from a biometric-verified human is ranked higher than content from a phone-verified account). {{style: { marginBottom: 16}}}

### Community moderation tools {{style: { marginTop: 0, marginBottom: 0}}}

For example, mutes and bans for breaking community guidelines can no longer be circumvented. {{style: { marginBottom: 16}}}

## For Developers

### Ideas

-   Integration with social network where a single person can only have 2 or 3 accounts. Each account is authenticated with a World ID. {{style: {margin: 0}}}
-   Posts in a feed are ranked based on level of personhood. {{style: {margin: 0}}}
-   Likes from verified humans are worth more. {{style: {margin: 0}}}

### Integrations

In addition to building new applications, there is already some great projects in the social space which could leverage World ID. {{style: {marginBottom: 0}}}
