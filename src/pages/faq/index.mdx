### Why not use EAS?

The Registry takes a lot of inspiration from EAS.
However, EAS has a few shortcomings that make it unattractive as an attestation service for us.

-   missing ERC1271 support
-   no hard link between deployed modules and schemas
-   no native crosschain attestation propagation

Further, the [Rhinestone Registry] does not aim to build a general-purpose attestations service, but our goal is to build a service that is flexible enough to serve the needs of different entities that want to bring their own opinions about the module lifecycle, yet is opinionated enough to add value and help push the modular AA ecosystem forward.
