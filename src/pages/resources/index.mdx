## Module ideas

There is a broad range of module categories and concrete module ideas that developers can build to enable specific product experiences for end users. Weâ€™ve compiled a non-exhaustive list of some modules that we think can greatly improve web3 UX and enable novel product features.

## Reference implementation demo

We are currently building a wallet application that allows users to easily customise their account and act as a testing ground and, later, distribution platform for developers. Watch the demo below to get a sense of how we imagine this reference implementation to look.

## Blog
