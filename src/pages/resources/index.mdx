## Module ideas

There is a broad range of module categories and concrete module ideas that developers can build to enable specific product experiences for end users. Weâ€™ve compiled a [non-exhaustive list](https://rhinestone.notion.site/Module-ideas-for-product-inspo-338100a2c99540f490472b8aa839da11) of some modules that we think can greatly improve web3 UX and enable novel product features.

## Reference implementation demo

We are currently building a wallet application that allows users to easily customise their account and act as a testing ground and, later, distribution platform for developers. Watch [the demo](https://rhinestone.wtf/demo) to get a sense of how we imagine this reference implementation to look.

## Blog

We regularly post overviews, technical deep-dives and product-idea explorations on [our blog](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf). Check it out in order to get information and inspiration and follow us to stay up-to-date with our latest content.
