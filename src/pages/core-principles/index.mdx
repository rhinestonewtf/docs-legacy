The Rhinestone Registry is designed as an open, free, and permissionless entity. Itsâ€™ architecture enables the registry to manage and coordinate various types of smart account modules, allowing smart accounts to tap into an ecosystem of third-party modules. It promotes a decentralized, collaborative environment, where entities can share, validate, and verify smart account modules across chains and are incentivised to contribute to the same entity rather than building similar systems in parallel.


<Note title="FYI">
  Rhinestone Registry is currenty  in **Beta** and in active development. Do not use these contracts on production.
